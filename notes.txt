# TimeSeriesGraph.py
- implement X forwarding of application / tunneling to obtain access to the stream
- on init of application legend gets cutoff
- add accompanying table to represent time series data ?
    - find new way to display table apart from using tkinter directly (slow)



Small Fixes
- implement dynamic viewing frame to update with user input
